        us, information you give to us in inquiries and other communications, and records of any transactions
        you perform. We share this information with affiliated and non-affiliated parties only as necessary to
        process and service your transactions with us, or as required by law. Such parties may include those
        who provide services to us in connection with your accounts or transactions, or who are involved in providing
        you the services you request. In certain instances they might include a purchaser or potential purchaser
        of an account. We also report information to credit bureaus in appropriate cases. And we share information

        <label class="bodylabel">Protection of Social Security Numbers</label>
        <br /> "We" refers to the family of companies owned by Elish Consulting. Like all financial services
        companies,
        we collect a variety of information about individuals, including but not limited to our customers and
        employees. In many cases that information includes individuals' Social Security numbers. We use records
        of Social Security numbers for many purposes, especially to comply with federal and state laws such as
        tax laws and anti-money-laundering laws. Our policy is (i) to comply with all laws restricting the use
        and disclosure of Social Security numbers, (ii) to protect the confidentiality of Social Security numbers,
        (iii) to prohibit the unlawful disclosure of Social Security numbers, and (iv) to limit access to Social
        Security numbers to our employees, and in certain cases to nonaffiliated parties that provide services
        to us, based on their responsibilities. To safeguard Social Security numbers, we maintain physical,
        electronic,
        and procedural safeguards that are designed to comply with applicable legal standards. Our employees
        are prohibited from disclosing Social Security numbers for unauthorized purposes. We may share Social
        Security numbers among our affiliated companies or with nonaffiliated parties for administrative purposes,
        such as to process transactions, verify identities, and service accounts. We disclose Social Security
        numbers as required or permitted by law, such as to the Internal Revenue Service or to credit bureaus.
        When necessary, we disclose Social Security numbers to regulatory agencies, law enforcement agencies,
        courts, and parties to lawsuits. We may share Social Security numbers among our affiliated companies
        for marketing purposes, but only in compliance with legal restrictions, including required opportunities
        to opt out of such sharing. We do not, without consent of the individual involved, share Social Security
        numbers with parties not affiliated with us to enable them to market their own products or services.

        <label class="bodylabel">Global USA PATRIOT Act Certification</label>
        <br /> In the wake of the September 11 attacks, President Bush signed the USA PATRIOT Act into law on October
        26, 2001. This landmark legislation calls for a major expansion of U.S. anti-money laundering compliance
        as well as anti-terrorism compliance obligations for all U.S. financial institutions. Pursuant to the
        USA PATRIOT Act and final rules issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, financial institutions operating
        in the United States are required to obtain certain information from any "Foreign Bank" that maintains
        a correspondent account with it in the U.S. Under the final rules, this information is collected through
        a certification process. To comply with these obligations, each of The Elish Consulting foreign branches
        and banking entities listed in the attachment hereto has completed the attached Global Certification
        for use by any U.S. financial institution that requires a USA PATRIOT Act Certification from any such
        The Elish Consulting foreign branch or entity. Please use this Certification instead of asking an individual
        The Elish Consulting foreign branch or entity to complete a separate Certification:
